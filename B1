   "description":"On the outside, he’s like a prince, but on the inside... he’s just like a mother?!

Mitsuge, the handsome cook who keeps getting dumped due to his high-level housework skills and overly-helpful personality, wants to pamper his recent obsession, the slightly clumsy restaurant server, Tomori. 

'You were looking at me so lewdly during our lunch break, weren’t you?'

When Mitsugi becomes captivated by the way Tomori eats his cooking so deliciously, it's not just love he's feeling but an 'appetite' too... Can this earnest love not be romantic?! A bitter-sweet love story.",
